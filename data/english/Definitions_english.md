# Definitions and Concepts (English)

## Consumer Product
A consumer product is a product that is directly available for purchase and use by patients themselves. No prescription or intervention from a healthcare professional is necessary. In some cases, a healthcare professional may prescribe a consumer product, for example a cream or nasal spray.

**Important:** If an innovation is sold directly to consumers, it may be more difficult to have the innovation recognized as insured care later.

**Examples:**
- Health apps that can be downloaded directly
- Wellness products
- Self-care articles
- Nutritional supplements

## Investment Product
An investment product is a product that is purchased by a healthcare provider to improve their care offering or care infrastructure, but which does not directly impact the composition and effectiveness of the original care.

**Examples of investment products:**
- Real estate
- Office equipment
- Transportation vehicles
- Non-medical equipment

**Examples of efficiency innovations:**
- Voice-controlled reporting technology
- Smart scheduling software
- Digital administration systems

**Examples:**
- Independently operating health apps
- Digital healthcare providers (chatbots, AI assistants)
- Automatic monitoring systems
- Self-help platforms

**Characteristics:**
- No direct healthcare provider involvement
- Independent functionality
- Direct patient-technology interaction
