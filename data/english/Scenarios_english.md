# Scenario 1: Consumer Product

If your innovation is a consumer product - a product that consumers can buy directly without healthcare provider involvement - then no standard reimbursement options exist through health insurance.

However, three alternative funding routes are available:

## 1. Direct consumer payment
Convince consumers to purchase your innovation themselves. The product must be affordable and the added value must be crystal clear to consumers. Focus on a clear value proposition and accessible pricing.

## 2. Supplementary insurance
Discuss with health insurers about inclusion in their supplementary insurance packages. Insurers may be willing to include your innovation in the supplementary insurance they offer to their members.

## 3. Employer and UWV funding
If your innovation contributes to sustainable employability of workers, employers can finance this through their employability budgets. UWV may also provide coverage for these types of innovations in certain cases.

# Scenario 2: Investment Product for Healthcare Providers

If your innovation is not a consumer product, but rather an investment product for healthcare providers or a solution that helps healthcare organizations work more efficiently, then a different funding route applies.

## Funding Strategy
Try to convince healthcare providers to purchase the innovation themselves. A strong business case that clearly demonstrates return on investment makes your innovation attractive to healthcare providers.

## Specific Situation: Independent Healthcare Professionals
For investment products aimed at independent healthcare professionals such as general practitioners, dentists, and physiotherapists, a special arrangement applies:

- **Initial financing**: These professionals must initially finance the innovation themselves
- **Long-term reimbursement**: If your innovation is scaled broadly, there's potential for reimbursement through the practice cost component
- **Practice cost component**: This is part of the fee that independent healthcare professionals may charge to health insurers

# Scenario 3: Proven Effective Health App Without Regular Healthcare Providers

If your innovation is not a consumer product and also not an investment product for healthcare providers, but is a healthcare innovation where regular healthcare providers play no role, then a specific funding route may apply.

For **proven effective health apps**, a special arrangement exists:

## Primary Funding Route: Zorgverzekeraars Nederland (ZN)
Zorgverzekeraars Nederland reimburses several proven apps that do not yet have a definitive funding structure through the "Digital Health Apps" project.

### Action Steps:
1. **First step**: Contact Zorgverzekeraars Nederland (ZN) to investigate whether your app qualifies for this program
2. **Alternative route**: Should ZN decide not to reimburse the app, then engage with individual health insurers about funding your innovation

## Requirements
- The app must be **proven effective**
- The app must function without direct involvement of regular healthcare providers
- No definitive funding structure may yet exist

# Scenario 4: Healthcare Innovation Without Regular Healthcare Providers (Non-Proven App)

If your innovation is not a consumer product, not an investment product for healthcare providers, and concerns a healthcare innovation where regular healthcare providers play no role, but is **not** a proven effective health app, then a different approach applies.

## Funding Strategy: Two-Track Policy

### 1. Arrange Temporary Funding
Engage with health insurers about temporary funding for your innovation. This gives you the opportunity to test your innovation in practice while working on gathering evidence.

### 2. Develop Evidence Base
Parallel to discussions about temporary funding, you must actively gather evidence for the effectiveness of your innovation. This evidence is essential for potential structural funding in the future.

## Important Considerations
- **Temporary nature**: The funding is initially intended to be temporary
- **Burden of proof**: You must be able to demonstrate that your innovation is effective
- **Insurer by insurer**: Each conversation must be conducted individually
- **Future perspective**: Strong evidence can lead to structural funding
