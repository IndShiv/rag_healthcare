# Practical Examples from the Healthcare Market (English)

## Case 1: Implementability over perfection

### *"Better a well-implementable than a beautiful product"*
**Daan Verbree, Platform Integration Officer, Topicus**

**Situation:**
About ten years ago, there were plans for midwifery collaborations (VSVs) where midwifery practices would be financed together with gynecology departments of hospitals. Topicus decided to develop a Maternity EPR for information exchange.

**What happened:**
The EPR ultimately didn't survive. Not because they didn't meet legal requirements, or because the software or infrastructure wasn't good. They failed because of the climate:
- It took a long time before those VSVs existed
- The entire structure soon came under pressure
- Hospitals found the organizational burden of integration too great
- They lacked both the manpower and courage

**Lessons learned:**
> *"This taught us that you need to work even more with standards. It may result in a less beautiful product, but one that's better implementable. I would now also delve much deeper into the target system, build more relationships with its supplier. And no longer expect everyone to easily go along with change. You can only change what you have a lot of control over yourself."*

**Key takeaways:**
- Work with existing standards for better implementability
- Delve deeper into target systems and build supplier relationships
- Don't expect everyone to easily embrace change
- Focus on changes you can control yourself

## Case 2: Market knowledge as foundation for success

### *"I had a broad view of the market we were entering"*
**Diederik de Rave, co-founder Attendi**

**Background:**
Diederik's mother was founder and director of a home care institution in Zeeland, where he had a part-time job from age fourteen. He knew from a young age how long-term care works, and saw that care professionals in that sector weren't yet working with voice-controlled reporting.

**Attendi's origin:**
The idea arose when he met someone with a technical background while traveling. Their software directly converts naturally spoken words into qualitative reports.

**Strategic advantages of market knowledge:**
> *"Thanks to my experience in healthcare, I had insight into what a care institution needs when purchasing software and what role an EPR supplier plays in that. I had a broad view of the market we were entering."*

**Successful implementation strategy:**
- From the beginning, developed technology that existing EPR suppliers could implement
- Critically assessed who would be willing to scale quickly
- Started with an innovative supplier with smaller market share
- A year later, larger suppliers also wanted to integrate the product
- Now grown to distribute products directly to customers alongside EPR integrations

**Key takeaways:**
- Deep market knowledge is crucial for success
- Start with integration into existing systems  
- Strategically choose first partners (innovative, smaller players)
- Gradually build up to larger market players
- Eventually develop own distribution channels
